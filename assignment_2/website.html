								This plot visualizes the flow of CO2 emissions
								from individual countries (left) to two key
								sources, fossil fuel and land-use change
								emissions (middle), and finally to their
								corresponding regions (right).
								<br />- Nodes: Represent categoriesâ€”countries,
								emission types, and regions. The width of each
								node indicates the relative size of emissions.
								<br />- Flows: Represent connections between
								nodes. The thickness of a flow reflects the
								magnitude of CO2 emissions contributed by the
								country to each category and region.

								The chart confirms that China, India, and the
								United States are the top CO2 emitters, with
								significant contributions from fossil fuels.
								Russia and Germany follow closely but exhibit
								relatively less land-use emissions. <br />In
								contrast, Brazil and the Democratic Republic of
								Congo stand out for their high land-use
								emissions, which are likely tied to
								deforestation in the Amazon and Congo Basin,
								respectively. <br />Interestingly, while
								wealthier countries dominate in fossil fuel
								emissions due to industrial activities, land-use
								emissions showcase the environmental impact in
								tropical regions, emphasizing the critical role
								of forest preservation.
