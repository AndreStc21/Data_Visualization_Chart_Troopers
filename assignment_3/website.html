								There are four main polluters: China, the USA,

								These countries have the highest emission levels

								economically powerful nations in the world.
								<br />All other countries contribute
								significantly less to global pollution compared

								This plot shows that the most polluting

								The countries that stand out the most are the
								United States of America, Australia and Saudi
								Arabia.<br />
								The U.S.A. has high overall emissions due to its
								immense wealth, even if it has a large
								population; while Australia and Saudi Arabia
								stand out for their high per capita pollution,
								which is driven by their small population and
								status of wealthy countries.
