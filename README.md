## 1. Self-Evaluation of Web Programming Skills

The group possesses a strong foundational knowledge of website development, proficient in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, and plain JavaScript. Notably, Andrea Stucchi has a moderate level of expertise in Tailwind CSS.

## 2. Technologies Planned for Web Programming

We plan to utilize HTML and CSS, including both raw CSS and possibly frameworks such as Bootstrap and/or Tailwind CSS. In addition, we will employ JavaScript, with a focus on D3.js, and express a willingness to explore Svelte as a JavaScript framework.

## 3. Strategies and Technologies for Data Handling and Processing

For data handling and processing, we will employ Python as our primary programming language. We intend to use Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning, as well as NumPy for numerical operations. For intermediate data visualization prior to integrating graphics into the web page, we will utilize either Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
