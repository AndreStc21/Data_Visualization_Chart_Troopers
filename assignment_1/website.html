							<h3 class="graph-titles">Last year per capita emissions</h3>
							<p>Per capita emissions can be misleading indicators, as in our case, especially when countries have very small, 
								wealthy populations that skew the overall assessment.
								<br>However, it remains an important metric because it highlights that the wealthiest individuals 
								often pollute significantly more than the average person.
								<br>This metric shifts the focus from identifying the most polluting countries 
								to pinpointing the individuals and groups with the highest environmental impact.

							<h3 class="graph-titles">Last decade per capita emissions</h3>
							<p>Again, we see that wealthy countries tend to have higher per capita emissions due to higher living standards,
								greater consumption of goods and services, energy-intensive industries, and reliance on fossil fuels for energy.
								<br>With smaller populations, even high emissions from specific sectors can result in a high per capita average.

							<h3 class="graph-titles">Last year per capita emissions - Continental comparison</h3>
							<p>Even though Asian countries have huge populations, they still have some of the highest per capita emissions.
								<br>Interestingly, North America, especially the United States, has much lower per capita emissions.

							<h3 class="graph-titles">Last year per capita emissions</h3>
							<p>Again, Although Asian countries have large populations, they still exhibit some of the highest per capita emission, meaning
								that they pollute the world a lot.
								<br>Once more we can notice that richer countries pollute more.

							<h3 class="graph-titles">Last year per capita emissions - Percentages</h3>
							<p>Once more we can notice that small and rich countries have higher per capita emissions.
								<br>The only countries that stand out are: Qatar, United Arab Emirates, United States and Canada, 
								which have high emissions per capita despite having a big population.

							<p>Clearly, China is the top polluter by far.
								<br>It is followed by the United States and India, in terms of fossil emissions, and Russia and Indonesia, in terms of land emissions.
