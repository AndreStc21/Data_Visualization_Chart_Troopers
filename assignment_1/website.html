						<p>
							In this section, we present an initial analysis of
							global CO2 emissions, providing an overview of
							emissions by country and region, both in total and
							per capita. Additionally, we include an analysis of
							emissions by type for specific countries.

								Top 10 - 2022 per capita CO2 emissions
							</h3>
							<p>
								To read the histogram, look at the horizontal
								axis for the countries and the vertical axis for
								CO2 emissions per capita in tonnes. The height
								of each bar shows the emissions level for each
								country.<br /><br />
								Per capita emissions can be misleading
								indicators, as in our case, especially when
								countries have very small, wealthy populations
								that skew the overall assessment. <br />However,
								it remains an important metric because it
								highlights that the wealthiest individuals often
								pollute significantly more than the average
								person. <br />This metric shifts the focus from
								identifying the most polluting countries to
								pinpointing the individuals and groups with the
								highest environmental impact.

							<p>
								Again, to read the histogram, look at the
								horizontal axis for the countries and the
								vertical axis for CO2 emissions per capita in
								tonnes. The height of each bar shows the
								emissions level for each country.<br /><br />
								We see that wealthy countries tend to have
								higher per capita emissions due to higher living
								standards, greater consumption of goods and
								services, energy-intensive industries, and
								reliance on fossil fuels for energy. <br />With
								smaller populations, even high emissions from
								specific sectors can result in a high per capita
								average.

								<br />Asian countries have the highest
								emissions, followed by Europe and North America,

								Asian countries, despite their large
								populations, stand out for their exceptionally
								high CO2 emissions, with China emitting more
								than double the amount of the USA.
								<br />This highlights Asia's significant
								contribution to global emissions. <br />In
								contrast, Africa and Oceania show much lower
								total emissions, reflecting smaller industrial
								activities and economies. The final plot
								emphasizes that even when individual countries
								in a region contribute less, their combined
								emissions can still represent a notable share of
								the total.

								Top 5 - 2022 total CO2 emissions - Percentages
							</h3>
							<p>
								For each continent, countries are sorted by the
								most polluter to the 5th most polluter, the last
								rectangle instead represents the total emissions
								of all the other countries in the same
								continent. <br /><br />Clearly, richer countries
								pollute more, and it is easy to notice since the
								first country for each continent is the richest
								one!<br />
								<br />This representation makes Australia appear
								as a highly polluting country, when in reality
								its high percentage is due to the fact that
								other countries in Oceania are too small and
								irrelevant. <br />In fact, looking at other
								graphs, we know that Australia doesn't pollute
								much. <br />While for North America we can't
								make the same reasoning, since USA are the main
								polluter of their continent not only because
								they are the most powerful and have the larger
								population, but also because they really pollute
								more.

								Top 10 - 2022 CO2 emission types comparison -
								Fossil vs Land
							</h3>
							<p>
								The heatmaps represent CO2 emissions split into
								two categories: fossil fuel emissions (top row)
								and land-use emissions (bottom row).
								<br /><br />- Shades of red indicate less
								emissions, while darker red represent higher
								emissions. <br />- Shades of green indicate
								negative emissions (net CO2 absorption), with
								darker green representing stronger absorption.
								<br />- White signifies near-zero emissions or
								absorption.<br />
								<br />China clearly stands out as the largest
								emitter in both fossil and land-use categories,
								particularly in fossil emissions. <br />The
								United States and India follow as major
								contributors in fossil emissions.
								<br />Interestingly, countries like Indonesia
								and China show significant land-use emissions,
								which reflect deforestation and land-use
								changes. On the other hand, Iran, Germany and
								others show negligible or no significant
								land-use emissions, focusing their impact on
								fossil fuel consumption. This dual perspective
								highlights the varying nature of CO2
								contributions, where some nations contribute
								predominantly through industrial activities,
								while others are more impacted by land-use
								practices.
